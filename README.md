# Integrating GRC Controls into Agile and DevSecOps Pipelines

## Project Title
**Embedding Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Controls in Agile and DevSecOps to Ensure Secure SDLC Compliance**

---

## 1. Introduction

Traditional security governance processes often lag behind the pace of modern software development. Agile and DevSecOps methodologies enable rapid software delivery, yet they pose unique challenges in embedding security and compliance. This project proposes a framework that integrates GRC controls directly into Agile sprints and CI/CD pipelines, using automation and predefined compliance policies aligned with NIST SP 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001.

---

## 2. Objectives and Scope

**Objectives:**
- Integrate GRC checkpoints into Agile backlogs and DevOps toolchains
- Enable real-time compliance reporting across SDLC stages
- Map controls to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and NIST SP 800-53
- Reduce audit fatigue and manual compliance verification

**Scope:**
- All agile software development teams
- Infrastructure-as-code and application pipelines
- Cloud-native and on-premises software delivery chains

---

## 3. Assurance Opinion

**Rating: Adequate**

The current development processes incorporate some security controls, but lack full alignment with compliance standards. Manual audits and after-the-fact security reviews increase risk and delay remediation. Integrating GRC within the SDLC improves traceability, accountability, and real-time compliance.

## 4. Findings

| Control Area | Observation |
|--------------|-------------|
| Change Management | GRC approvals are performed post-deployment, introducing audit gaps |
| Code Security | Static analysis is used inconsistently across teams |
| Risk Triage | Risk assessments are not documented during backlog grooming |
| Monitoring & Alerting | No integration with audit tools for SDLC traceability |
| Policy Mapping | ISO/NIST mappings not embedded in CI/CD checks |

---

## 5. Areas for Development

| Priority | Area |
|---------|------|
| High | Shift left GRC controls into code commit and CI stages |
| High | Define JIRA compliance workflows for control traceability |
| Medium | Align policies to DevSecOps reference architectures |
| Medium | Automate security test results into GRC dashboards |
| Low | Create reusable control library YAML snippets for pipelines |

---

## 6. Action Plan

**Step 1: Control Library Mapping**
- Create YAML-based control definitions tagged by NIST/ISO control IDs
- Examples: AC-2 (User Access), CM-3 (Configuration Baseline), RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)

**Step 2: Pipeline Integration**
- Embed policy-as-code in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps
- Trigger gates on failed control validation (e.g., missing SBOM, scan failure)

**Step 3: Compliance Tracking**
- Use JIRA to log control implementation tickets
- Implement Confluence for centralized control documentation
- Sync audit trails with Microsoft Purview or ServiceNow GRC

**Step 4: Agile Sprint Workflow Enhancements**
- Risk scoring added to story estimation
- Retrospectives include control gap analysis
- Threat modeling required during backlog grooming

## 7. Tools & Platforms Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| GitHub Actions / GitLab CI | CI/CD integration for policy checks |
| SonarQube / Snyk / Checkov | Code and infrastructure security scans |
| Jira / Confluence | Agile compliance documentation and tracking |
| Microsoft Purview / ServiceNow GRC | Audit trail and control reporting |
| YAML / JSON | Standardized control policy definitions |

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

- GRC must evolve into developer workflows rather than remain external
- Policy-as-code enables real-time enforcement of compliance controls
- Risk awareness in Agile promotes secure design by default
- JIRA-based traceability reduces audit costs and improves transparency
- DevSecOps and GRC alignment requires cultural, procedural, and tooling integration
